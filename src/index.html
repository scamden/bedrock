<h1 class="margin-bottom0">Welcome to the Shell App</h1>

<p class="margin-bottom0">
    The shell app is a Typescript/Angular 1.x based shell that provides the same basic
    environment as the CRM web application, including UIQ, Routing, and familiar
    build tools.  It also provides all the fun stuff you need to get up and running
    with typescript (including build tools, basic type definitions for node,
    angular, ES6, etc.).
</p>

<p class="margin-bottom0">
    See the README.md for detailed information about the project structure, tooling,
    and other useful fun stuff.
